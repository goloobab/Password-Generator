# Password-Generator

## Description 

This project is aa password generator written and developed using Javascript. The user of this application will be prompted to enter the length on the password they wish between 10 - 64 characters. This will be followed witha series of options to choose from for example 'Do you need the password to have capital letters ?'. The choices from the users input will be saved and a will password generated / displayed inline with the options selected.  This is part of my learning journey  towards web development.

## Task
Generate a password when the button is clicked.

Present a series of prompts for password criteria:

* Length of password:
* At least 10 characters but no more than 64.
* Character types:
* Lowercase
* Uppercase
* Numeric
* Special characters ($@%&*, etc.)

Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected.

Once all prompts are answered, the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page.

## Challenges

* Validating users input choices. 
* Selecting elements from the different array options.
* Variable naming
* Determining which loop to use and where.

## Things I learned 
* How to use the prompts, confirm and alerts
* Nesting functions
* The random functions
* How to declare and use variables globally and locally.
* How to apply loops in validation
